		// start with strings, numbers and booleans

		// Let's say we have an array
		const players = ['German', 'James', 'Li', 'Jane'];

		// and we want to make a copy of it.

		// You might think we can just do something like this:
		const playersCopy = players;
		// however what happens when we update that array?
		playersCopy[0] = 'Dan'
		// now here is the problem!
		console.log(players);
		console.log(playersCopy);
		// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

		// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

		// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

		// one way
		const copyArr = players.slice()
		// or create a new array and concat the old one in
		const concatArr = [].concat(players)
		console.log(concatArr)
		// or use the new ES6 Spread
		const spreadArr = [...players]
		const copyFrom = Array.from(players)
		// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

		// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

		// with Objects
		const person = {
			name: 'German',
			age: 20,
			social: {
				twitter: "@germancss",
				github: "@unpin"
			}
		};

		// and think we make a copy:
		const personRef = person
		// how do we take a copy instead?
		const objCopy = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 27 })
		console.log(person);
		console.log(objCopy);
		// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
		// Note: Object spread was added with the release of ECMAScript 2018
		const spreadObj = { ...person }
		console.log(spreadObj);
		// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
		const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, person)
		console.log("Shallow copying");
		shallowCopy.social.github = "bilaloff"
		console.log(shallowCopy.social);
		console.log(person.social);
		// JSON Copying Trick AKA "Poor man's deep clone"
		console.log("Deep copying");
		const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
		deepCopy.name = 'Jack'
		deepCopy.age = 35
		deepCopy.social.github = 'jacklondon'
		console.log(person);
		console.log(deepCopy);
